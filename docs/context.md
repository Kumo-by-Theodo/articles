## What is dev.to?

https://dev.to is a free and open source blogging platform for developers.

> dev.to (or just DEV) is a platform where software developers write articles, take part in discussions, and build their professional profiles. We value supportive and constructive dialogue in the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans from beginner to advanced developers, and all are welcome to find their place within our community.

## Why would I want to put all my blog posts on a git repo?

- Don't be afraid to mess up with one of your articles while editing it
- Same good practices as when you're developing (format, commits, saving history, compare, etc)
- Use prettier to format the markdown and all the code
- Let people contribute to your article by creating a PR against it (tired of comments going sideways because of some typos? Just let people know they can make a PR at the end of your blog post)
- Create code examples close to your blog post and make sure they're correct thanks to [Embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme) (_\*1_)

_\*1: Embedme allows you to write code in actual files rather than your readme, and then from your Readme to make sure that your examples are matching those files._

If you prefer not to use Prettier or Embed me, you can do so by simply removing them but I think it's a nice thing to have!
